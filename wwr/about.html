            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The rafting company was founded in 1995 by two brothers who grew up rafting the rivers of the area. They started with just a few rafts and a handful of employees, but over the years they have grown into one of the largest and most respected rafting companies in the region. They now offer a variety of rafting trips, from beginner-friendly floats to challenging whitewater runs. In addition to rafting, they also offer other activities such as kayaking, fishing, and hiking.

                The rafting company's website is a great resource for information on their programs and activities. The site is easy to navigate and provides a wealth of information for potential customers.
